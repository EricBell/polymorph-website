Option B — if you have Hugo installed locally:
hugo --config hugo.toml --baseURL "https://polymorph.co/" --destination ./public --minify --environment production --cleanDestinationDir

 Here's your workflow:                                                      
                                                                                      
  Local Development & Testing                                                         
                                                                                      
  Option 1: Using Hugo server (recommended for development)                           
  hugo server --buildDrafts --buildFuture                                             
  This will:                                                                          
  - Start a live-reloading server at http://localhost:1313                            
  - Auto-rebuild when you save changes                                                
  - Show draft posts (add draft = true in frontmatter)                                
  - Much faster than full builds                                                      
                                                                                      
  Option 2: Using Docker Compose (matches production exactly)                         
  docker-compose up                                                                   
  Then visit http://localhost (requires nginx port mapping in docker-compose.yml)     
                                                                                      
  Production Deployment Workflow                                                      
                                                                                      
  Yes, your workflow should work:                                                     
                                                                                      
  1. Create content locally → Test with hugo server                                   
  2. Push to remote repo → git push                                                   
  3. Redeploy in Dokploy → Triggers the docker-compose build                          
                                                                                      
  The deployment will:                                                                
  - Run the init-perms service                                                        
  - Build with Hugo (using the command in your notes file)                            
  - Generate the ./public/ directory with your new content                            
  - Nginx serves it at https://polymorph.co/                                          
                                                                                      
  Important: Make sure your docker-compose.yml in Dokploy is configured to rebuild the
   hugo service on deploy. The current setup should work since the hugo service builds
   the site at startup.                                                               
                                                                                      
  Want me to help you create some sample content to test this workflow?

Changing themes:
 Technical Implications:                                                             
                                                                                      
  Easy stuff:                                                                         
  1. Add theme as submodule:                                                          
  git submodule add https://github.com/user/theme-name.git themes/theme-name          
  2. Update hugo.toml:                                                                
  theme = 'theme-name'                                                                
  3. Test locally before deploying                                                    
                                                                                      
  Potential issues:                                                                   
  - Each theme has different config requirements (check theme's docs)                 
  - Some need specific front matter in your posts                                     
  - Some require Hugo modules instead of submodules                                   
  - Homepage content structure varies by theme                                        
                                                                                      
  Security Implications:                                                              
                                                                                      
  Low risk if you:                                                                    
  - ✅ Use popular, well-maintained themes (GitHub stars > 500, recent updates)       
  - ✅ Stick to themes from known authors or Hugo's theme showcase                    
  - ✅ Review the theme's code (at least briefly scan layouts/)                       
  - ✅ Test locally before deploying                                                  
                                                                                      
  Higher risk:                                                                        
  - ❌ Random themes from unknown sources                                             
  - ❌ Abandoned themes (no updates in years)                                         
  - ❌ Themes with no community/reviews                                               
                                                                                      
  Why? Themes run during Hugo build and could theoretically:                          
  - Inject malicious content into your site                                           
  - Exfiltrate data during build                                                      
  - Include vulnerable dependencies                                                   
                                                                                      
  Recommended Approach:                                                               
                                                                                      
  1. Browse Hugo themes: https://themes.gohugo.io/                                    
  2. Pick popular ones - look for:                                                    
    - High GitHub stars                                                               
    - Recent updates                                                                  
    - Good documentation                                                              
    - Active community                                                                
  3. Test locally first:                                                              
  git submodule add <theme-url> themes/<theme-name>                                   
  # Update hugo.toml                                                                  
  hugo server                                                                         
  4. If it works, deploy:                                                             
  git add .gitmodules themes/ hugo.toml                                               
  git commit -m "Add theme-name theme"                                                
  git push                                                                            
                                                                                      
  Current Themes You Have:                                                            
                                                                                      
  - ananke - Feature-rich, good for content-heavy sites                               
  - coder - Minimal, developer-focused                                                
                                                                                      
  Want me to help you add a specific theme, or recommend some based on your site's    
  needs?
