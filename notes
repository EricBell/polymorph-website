Option B — if you have Hugo installed locally:
hugo --config hugo.toml --baseURL "https://polymorph.co/" --destination ./public --minify --environment production --cleanDestinationDir

 Here's your workflow:                                                      
                                                                                      
  Local Development & Testing                                                         
                                                                                      
  Option 1: Using Hugo server (recommended for development)                           
  hugo server --buildDrafts --buildFuture                                             
  This will:                                                                          
  - Start a live-reloading server at http://localhost:1313                            
  - Auto-rebuild when you save changes                                                
  - Show draft posts (add draft = true in frontmatter)                                
  - Much faster than full builds                                                      
                                                                                      
  Option 2: Using Docker Compose (matches production exactly)                         
  docker-compose up                                                                   
  Then visit http://localhost (requires nginx port mapping in docker-compose.yml)     
                                                                                      
  Production Deployment Workflow                                                      
                                                                                      
  Yes, your workflow should work:                                                     
                                                                                      
  1. Create content locally → Test with hugo server                                   
  2. Push to remote repo → git push                                                   
  3. Redeploy in Dokploy → Triggers the docker-compose build                          
                                                                                      
  The deployment will:                                                                
  - Run the init-perms service                                                        
  - Build with Hugo (using the command in your notes file)                            
  - Generate the ./public/ directory with your new content                            
  - Nginx serves it at https://polymorph.co/                                          
                                                                                      
  Important: Make sure your docker-compose.yml in Dokploy is configured to rebuild the
   hugo service on deploy. The current setup should work since the hugo service builds
   the site at startup.
